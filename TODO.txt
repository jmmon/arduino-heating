Sketch uses 18510 bytes (60%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
Global variables use 1348 bytes (65%) of dynamic memory, leaving 700 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

disabling proportional PWM



testing "static const byte" chars for the custom chars
didn't work; is there another type which would work (and save space)?



Could use net-above/below-temperature time to bump set temperature up, so heat starts sooner to help balance out the net-above/below-temperature

Cleaned up variables!

before:
	Sketch uses 26416 bytes (85%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
	Global variables use 1389 bytes (67%) of dynamic memory, leaving 659 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

after:
	Sketch uses 23482 bytes (76%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
	Global variables use 1289 bytes (62%) of dynamic memory, leaving 759 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.


Saved this much: !!
	26416 - 23482 = 	2934 bytes storage,
	1389 - 1289 =  		100 bytes memory



TODO 4/3/22

(using the t-stat pin with a different wavelength to distinguish)

Add screen menu functionality using a button to switch between screens.

press => cycles to the next page in the menu cycle (all pages existing);
				- starts a timer: 5 seconds?
					* after time is up, switches to view cycle
				- minimum time between presses to be sure it's intentional (~150ms?)

double press => pause the screen (pause the cycle timer)

press+hold => enable/disable page from the view cycle 
			-(beep will sound: a "do, mi" or "do fa" note frequencies)





Dec 4th:

	Idea: could change the LCD pages so it compiles a string and then prints it
		That may reduce size and could diff check on last vs next strings and only print when changed?\
	Can't do this with custom icons probably..?
	\xhh
	where hh == hexadecimal value of special character
	

	Water level is a bit behind where it should be, wonder if I could tweak the numbers better. 
		Seems to be behind by ~7+%!!!

	Water level does not beep once hitting full!!!




Dec 31st:

	Should keep a trend (other than jus tthe floor temp) and use it to maintain temperature better.
	Problem: When super cold outside, the inside set temperature is a little cold;
	And when not as cold, the inside temperature is a little warm!


	Trying to make it so when the temperature is warmer outside, the inside heats a little less. (Move the target temperature lower for example).
	When the temperature is colder outside, the inside heats up a little more. (Move the target temperature higher for example)

*** Should make a variable: some sort of ratio. That way I can tweak the variable to change how the trend affects the target temperature.
  e.g. fastDrop_ratio ??



Jan 19th 2023:
	Need to make sure water alarm works better!
	Should be preemptive: for example:
		If tank is > 80% and recent water-level-trend is high, start the alarm!
	That way I (hopefully) don't run into the issue of overfilling
