Sketch uses 18510 bytes (60%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
Global variables use 1348 bytes (65%) of dynamic memory, leaving 700 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

disabling proportional PWM



testing "static const byte" chars for the custom chars
didn't work; is there another type which would work (and save space)?



Could use net-above/below-temperature time to bump set temperature up, so heat starts sooner to help balance out the net-above/below-temperature

Cleaned up variables!

before:
	Sketch uses 26416 bytes (85%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
	Global variables use 1389 bytes (67%) of dynamic memory, leaving 659 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

after:
	Sketch uses 23482 bytes (76%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
	Global variables use 1289 bytes (62%) of dynamic memory, leaving 759 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.


Saved this much: !!
	26416 - 23482 = 	2934 bytes storage,
	1389 - 1289 =  		100 bytes memory



TODO 4/3/22

(using the t-stat pin with a different wavelength to distinguish)

Add screen menu functionality using a button to switch between screens.

press => cycles to the next page in the menu cycle (all pages existing);
				- starts a timer: 5 seconds?
					* after time is up, switches to view cycle
				- minimum time between presses to be sure it's intentional (~150ms?)

double press => pause the screen (pause the cycle timer)

press+hold => enable/disable page from the view cycle 
			-(beep will sound: a "do, mi" or "do fa" note frequencies)
