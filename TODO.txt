disabling proportional PWM



testing "static const byte" chars for the custom chars
didn't work; is there another type which would work (and save space)?



Could use net-above/below-temperature time to bump set temperature up, so heat starts sooner to help balance out the net-above/below-temperature










TODO 4/3/22

(using the t-stat pin with a different wavelength to distinguish)

Add screen menu functionality using a button to switch between screens.

press => cycles to the next page in the menu cycle (all pages existing);
				- starts a timer: 5 seconds?
					* after time is up, switches to view cycle
				- minimum time between presses to be sure it's intentional (~150ms?)

double press => pause the screen (pause the cycle timer)

press+hold => enable/disable page from the view cycle 
			-(beep will sound: a "do, mi" or "do fa" note frequencies)
