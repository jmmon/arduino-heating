Heat_4.0.0

Old radiant heating temperature reading/control:::

Every 2000ms (2 seconds): checkTemperature

    And:

Every 10 seconds, adjust trend
    if current EMA < medium EMA (or long EMA...) do trend--
    else if current EMA > medium EMA (or long EMA...) do trend++
    
    Then, limit the trend to +/- 16

    So: 10s * 16 = 160s = 2m40s. So if the temp is warming up for 2m40s, the pump will shut off 0.32* cooler than set temperature


And how the trend is used:
    We want the pump OFF if:
        temperature is reached,
	OR
	trend > 0 (getting warmer) && temperature > (setpoint - trendOffset), where trendOffset == 0.02 * avgTrend

	So 0.02 * 16 = 0.32 degrees. So if temp gets to (setpoint - 0.32*F) the pump turns off.


4.0.1:
if current EMA < medium EMA (we're dropping temperature):
   if medium EMA (prev EMA) < weighted average temp {
       if (trend < -10) add 10
       else if > -10 set to 0
    } else if (medium EMA >= weighted average temp{
        (last EMA is > average temperature): trend -= 1
    }

if (current EMA > medium/prev EMA (we're rising temperature):
    if prev EMA > weighted average temp{
        if (trend >= 10) subtract 10
	else if (< 10) set to 0
    else if (medium <= weighted average temp) {
        trend + 1
    }


Then cap the trends to min or max : 360

And then:
    if temp reached, or if trending up && temp > (setpoint - 0.003 * trend)
    So 0.003 * 360 = 1.080 degrees 
    So if trending up and temp > setpoint - 1.08, we turn off the pump because we assume it will coast to above the target.

    How often does trend change? 10 seconds
    How long would temp need to be rising to reach 360?? 10s * 360 = 3600s == 1 hour
    If temp rises, then falls, then rises again, what might the trend do?
        Rises to 180 over 1800 seconds, then falls over 600 seconds (60 occurrances) => -= (60 * 10) == -= 600 so back to 0 or goes - 180 to 0 then - 42 * 1 => -42 trend.. Then rises again over 1800 seconds (180 occurances) => 5 brings to 0, then +1 * 175 => ending with 175 trend!


So Maybe it's better to plan it out this way:
    If temp is rising,
        // moving towards 0 goes fast, moving away from 0 goes slow
        if trend is negative, add 10 to the trend
	else add 1 to the trend

    else if temp is falling
        if trend is positive, subtract 10 from the trend
	else subtract 1 from the trend


Or another way:
    If temp is rising, (trend should be increasing)
        If current is a lot higher than the previous, the temp is increasing fast
	    so then if moving towards 0, move trend 8x
	    else if moving away from 0, move trend 2x
	Else if it's just a little higher, the temp is increasing slower
	    So then if moving towards 0, move trend 8x?
	    else if moving away from 0, move trend 1x

    If temp is falling (trend should be decreasing)
        If current is a lot lower than the previous, the temp is decreasing fast
	    So if moving towards 0, move trend 8x
	    Else move trend 2x
	Else if it's a little lower than previous, it's decreasing slowly
	    So if moving towards 0, move trend 8x?
	    else if moving away from 0, move trend 1x
